Please note, this project is no longer necessary as Salesforce now provides email and RSS subscription options for instance alerts.

# Salesforce Status Alerts

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Heroku nodejs app that periodically checks status.salesforce.com and sends you email notification of any incidents.

This is a weekend hobby project to teach myself about Heroku, nodejs, npm, and learn the https://api.status.salesforce.com/v1/docs/ REST API for checking instance status.
